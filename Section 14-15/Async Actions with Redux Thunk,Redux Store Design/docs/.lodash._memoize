/******************** lodash _,memoize ********************/

npm install --save lodash

- When sending multiple requests to the same end point 
- like our case, we sent 100 different reuests instead of 10, because 
   we had to send reuqest for each post (when we have only 10 users )
- when using memoize(ourFunction) function, it helps us with this behvaiour.
- the memoize(ourFunction) takes in a referance to the function that was created by us
    (which is sending some request)
- it returns a new copy of our fuction ( memoize version of our function)
- this new function has the same behaviour of our function, but - the only difference
  is that we can only call this function ONE TIME WITH ANY UNIQUE SET OF ARGUMENTS
- after we call it one time, we can still call it, but the original function 
  will is not going actually envoked.
- for example : 

// our function : getUser();
// const memoizedGetUser = -.memoize(getUser);
// calling it with id 3 - memoizedGetUser(3) // invoked
// calling it with id 3 again - memoizedGetUser(3) not invoked
// caling it with a different argument memoizedGetUser(4) invoked.
