***************** What is Redux? *****************/

/***************** Redux Cycle *****************/

- Action Creator - Person dropping off the form
- Action - the form it self ( the form has a type and payload)
- Dispatch - form reciver. takes in the action, will make copies of 
             it and pass it to different part in our application
- Reducers - Departments(claim, polisy...); function which takes in a function and some data
             it going to process that action and the data, make change in the data 
             and return the updated data
- State - Complied department data. Central repositry which holds the relevan data
          that is relevant to our all application and 
           can be retrived from all part of our App


1. every time we want to change the state or the data of our application
   we are calling an action creator
2. calling an action creator is going to produce an action object
   which describes how exactly we want to change our data inside our app
3. dispatch take in our actions and forwards it to our reducers
 (dispatch runs the entire cycle)
4. the reducers going to run, they will take our data and return new data
5. the data that returned is going to our new state object
